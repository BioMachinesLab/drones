TO-DO Hardware:
	- Check https://code.google.com/p/i2c-gps-nav/ project. Possible alternative to UART population?
	
	
TO-DO Controller:
	- Dont shutdown motors when there are multiple clients (connection class)
	- Create a io manager (remove all the hardware initialization from the controller)
	- Extract I2C manager to a separate class (already done on the I2CBusController, but not used, yet)


TO-DO GUI:
	
- Compile just our code (without having to compile the entire code)
